👋 Hi, I’m Vance Braziel,
Allow me to quickly introduce myself:
- Military veteran with 20 years of IT experience. Focusing on Software development.
- I’m interested in learning and growing in computing technology. I developed a passion
for computers when I was 13 years old. My first computer was my friend's IMB PC-5350 with
MS-DOS and a small hard drive. It was here that I first learned about BASIC.

Ciao
