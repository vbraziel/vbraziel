Hello, I am Vance Braziel.

I am a military veteran with 20 years of experience in IT, specializing in software development. My journey in computing technology began at the age of 13 with my friend’s IBM PC-5350 running MS-DOS, where I first learned BASIC. I am passionate about continuous learning and growth in the field of computing technology.
