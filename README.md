ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vance Braziel,
Allow me to quickly introduce myself:
- Military veteran with 20 years of IT experience. Focusing on Software development.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning and growing in computing technology. I developed a passion
for computers when I was 13 years old. My first computer was my friend's IMB PC-5350 with
MS-DOS and a small hard drive. It was here that I first learned about BASIC.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working my way through the freecodecamp curriculum and my bachelor's at WGU.
- ðŸ“« Contact $contact (Twitter) = @vbraziel82;

Sincerely,
Vance
